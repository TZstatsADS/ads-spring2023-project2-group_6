[Contribution Statement] 
All team members contributed in all stages of this project. Every team member carried out data collection and data preprocessing for each type of vehicle (e.g., Subways, Buses, Cars etc.). The details of each member's contribution are as follows:

Denise Rahmadina carried out data collection and data preprocessing for Pedestrian type. 
Jiahao Wei carried out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Bike.
Junhan Huang out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Cars.
Saloni Dingore out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Ferry.
Yi Sun out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Subway and Bus.

From all mentioned vehicle type we after manipulating data we made the decision to move on with the subway, bus, and car types of vehicles because the others lacked the necessary data for analysis.

Denise Rahmadina and Jiahao Wei carried out data retrieving, data preprocessing and manipulation for the MTA (Subway) data and was in charge for "Map" tab

Junhan Huang implemented all UI beautification and was in charge of the "Intro" and "References" tabs. He created a single dashboard out of all the separate UI and server files for the various tabs.

Saloni Dingore carried out data preprocessing and manipulation for the MTA (Subway) data and was in charge for "Payment" tab. 

Yi Sun carried data processing and manipulation for ridership data for Subway & Bus, and was in charge for “Bus vs. Subway Statistics tab”.  Moreover, since our group focused on MTA subway, Yi Sun conducted an analysis between Subway’s ridership and Covid at two extreme periods and based on news we did find a relationship between them.
