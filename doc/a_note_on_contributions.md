Junhan Huang out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Cars.
Saloni Dingore out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Ferry.
Yi Sun out data collection and data preprocessing for vehicle type Subway and Bus.

From all mentioned vehicle type we after manipulating data we made the decision to move on with the subway, bus, and car types of vehicles because the others lacked the necessary data for analysis.

Denise Rahmadina and Jiahao Wei carried out data retrieving, data preprocessing and manipulation for the MTA (Subway) data and was in charge for "Ridership Map" tab

Junhan Huang carried out data preprocessing and manipulation for the traffic data (Vehicle type Car) and was in charge for "Traffic Data" tab. He created a single dashboard out of all the separate UI and server files for the various tabs.
